4) How to test middle level:
unit test (should be verify fast)

5) performance:
if your "moderate" code depends on other "Heavy" code,
improvement of your code could not result of huge performance improvement


6) Tests and logging:
 again, run fast unittest
    6.1)in case your test is taking too long:
    log/snapshot details
    run backgroud  jobs to verify that snapshots
